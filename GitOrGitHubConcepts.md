  GitHub is a web-based hosting service for version control using Git. 
It is mostly used for computer code. It offers all of the distributed 
version control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git 
as well as adding its own features.
  It provides access control and several collaboration features such 
as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, and wikis for 
every project.
  GitHub offers plans for enterprise, team, pro and free accounts 
which are commonly used to host open-source software projects. As 
of January 2019, GitHub offers unlimited private repositories to 
all plans, including free accounts.
  As of June 2018, GitHub reports having over 28 million users 
and 57 million repositories (including 28 million public repositories),
making it the largest host of source code in the world.
