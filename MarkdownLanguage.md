# MarkdownLanguage</br>

Markdown grammar is fully compatible with HTML grammar - that is to say, in GitHub's .md page, it's entirely feasible to use HTML grammar alone to express what you want to achieve.</br>

The goal of Markdown grammar is to become a writing language suitable for the network. Markdown does not want to replace HTML, or even be close to it. It has very few kinds of grammar, which corresponds to only a small part of HTML tags. Markdown's idea is not to make HTML documents easier to write. In my opinion, HTML is already easy to write. The idea of Markdown is to make documents easier to read, write and change at will. HTML is a publishing format and Markdown is a writing format. In this way, Markdown's format grammar covers only what plain text can cover. Tags that are not covered by Markdown can be written in HTML directly in the document. There's no need to label this as HTML or Markdown; just label it directly. Only some HTML block elements, such as &#60;div&#62;, &#60;table&#62;, &#60;pre&#62;, &#60;p&#62; tags, must be separated from other content areas by blank lines before and after, and their start and end tags must not be indented by tabs or spaces. Markdown's generator is smart enough not to add unnecessary &#60;p&#62; tags to HTML block tags.</br>
